A cluster is an instance of Kubernetes. It contains a collection of [[Node]]s and a [[Control Plane]] to govern them all. Since kubernetes is an instance, you can have multiple clusters within different environments all running different versions of kubernetes. In the cluster level you are more concerned about overall health, scalability and performance.
