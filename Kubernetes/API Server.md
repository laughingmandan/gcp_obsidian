The API Server is the front end for the [[Cluster]].  The main use for it is to allow the end user to dictate how the [[Control Plane]] is to manage the nodes. The end user is not the only item that uses the API Server. The entire [[Control Plane]] also uses it to give commands to each other. It abstract the implementation of the [[Control Plane]] and [[Node]]s to allow for easy updates.
