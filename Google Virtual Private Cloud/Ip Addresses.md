## Static Ip Addresses
Good to knows:
You pay for static IPs until you release them. Even if they are not in use. 
When reserving a static Ip address make sure it lives in the same location as the item you are trying to give it to.
- Global apps require global IPs
- Regional apps require regional IPs
