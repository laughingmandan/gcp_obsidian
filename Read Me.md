If you just want to pass the test buy these practice questions: https://www.udemy.com/course/full-practice-exams-google-professional-cloud-developer/ They are almost exactly the same questions. I am pretty sure the guy who made this took the test multiple times and just used the REAL questions for the practice questions.

First folders are for a products. Every folder within those folders is a group of very closely related concepts.
If you want explain the group of concepts please create a note within the folder.
