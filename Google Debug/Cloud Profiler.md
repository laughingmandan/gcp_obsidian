Is an in production time and space Profiler. It estimates both by monitoring CPU usage and memory allocation for 10 seconds every minute. Those results are then aggregated to deliver an accurate estimation of resource usage. T

Because the profiler uses less than 5% resources and it only does it for 10 seconds every minute it achieves a low enough impact for it to be run on production.
