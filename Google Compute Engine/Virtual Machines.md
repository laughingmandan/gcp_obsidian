Virtual Machines are essentially computers within the cloud


## Cost savings
There are three ways to save cost

##### Long Run Virtual Machines
The longer you  use the VM the cheaper it gets. This is automatic.
##### Committed use VMs
If you know you will be using a VM for as long or longer than 1 year then you can apply for a committed use VM which will save moolah.
##### Preemptible VMs
If you can handle fault tolerance then you can use Preemptible VMs. They are VMs that are not solely yours. So if a higher priority client comes around they might boot you out of the VM to run their own application. Great for big computation that can be done in clusters.
