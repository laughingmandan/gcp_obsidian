An instance template is a [[Virtual Machines]] configuration that includes [[Machine Types]], [[Boot Disk Image]], labels, startup script etc. You can not change this template rather you have to make a copy, make the changes on that copy, delete the original, and rename the copy to be the original.

## When to use
Whenever you need to create a large amount of similar [[Virtual Machines]]
